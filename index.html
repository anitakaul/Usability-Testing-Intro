  <h2>I am a student at the University of Pittsburgh studying Computer Science with a minor in Computer Engineering. Currently, I'm taking courses in Systems Software, Physics, and Formal Methods. I initially was a Computational Biology and DNID major too, but I am very indecisive. In my time here at Pitt, I work as a Student Developer for the University Library System and I'm involved in the Women in Computer Science Club and Panther Racing.</h2>

My family consists of my older sister and younger brother (who both also go to Pitt), my mom, and my dog, Ruby. It's super special to have siblings that are so close in age to me, they've influenced a lot of my childhood since we've had similar experiences at around the same time!

         <h1>Why UX Design and Usability Testing? </h1>
  <h2>I consider myself a super artsy person. A lot of my hobbies include crotcheting, sewing, painting, guitar, piano, and more! Coming from a computing background, I find the intersection of art, humanities, and tech to be super fun and interesting. A big reason why I got into computer engineering is the fact that I can see a direct product of my code in front of me, and UX Design and Usability testing is another great example of how even the most abstract concepts can be made into not just a tangible object or an interface, but an experience that is dependent on both front and back end. </h2>

<!--Let's talk a little about the future. After school what kind of job or career would you like to pursue? What is your reasoning for going on this path? How might it connect to all of these prior elements--field of study, home and family, interests and activities? Why is this job or career important to you? Why is it important generally?-->
    
<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">   
         <h1>Where do you want your knowledge and skills to take you?</h1>
  <h2>After school, I'd love to work for a company that values good work-life balance but also be doing a job that I enjoy. I would love to work for an ethical robotics, autonomous vehicle, or aerospace company. I think it would be fun to problem solve in fields that are still being discovered and pushing limits of computation to provide solutions to real problems. After being in the field for a number of years, I would like to pursue a graduate degree so I can become a teacher or an educator on the topics I'm passionate about. I love learning new things and teaching what I've learned, so I think it would be a good sequence. I think I find this career important because I tend to think that there's not huge end goal to everything. The main thing I value is time for myself, time for friends and family, and stability. This career path ensures all three of these, plus I enjoy it! </h2>
